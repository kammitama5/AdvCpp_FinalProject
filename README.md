# Moon Man
Traversing the moon and colonizing that land! Character's name is Buzz :)

## Specifications

- Must use Inheritance : Derived classes (player inherits sprite)
- Must use File I/O (sprite, background, quit button)

## Things I did use additionally
- exception handling (For each file I/O)

## Used (IDEs, etc)
- SFML 2.4.2
- Visual Studio 2013 (C++)
- GIMP (textures)
- Piskel (sprite Sheet)

## Ideas
- a Platformer game where I can add some basic tiles
- One level (use Paint or GIMP for tile sheet)
- Use SFML (teaching myself)
  - intent is to use an unfamiliar stack and learn more about C++

## Keep a log of progress to stay on track

- Week one:  10/30 to 11/4 - UML and basic plan done
- Week two:  11/6 to 11/11 (you are out of town on the 9th: Haskell!) - sprite sheet and bkground done
- Week three: 11/13 to 11/18 - sprite sheet and background load
- Week four: 11/20 to 11/25 - menu button works for quit
- Week five: 11/27 to 12/2 - sprite animation and input handling + physics (jumping), pause, sound
- three days 12/3 to 12/6 (final exam on 12/6) - (you'll actually not be in town)
- Week six: 12/7 to 12/8 (Thurs + Friday) - physics (gravity)
- Week seven: 12/11 and 12/12: General debugging and write-up (UML, write-up, submit files)

## Can continue working on game after class is done
- Window border collision
- collision between ground and player
- physics (gravity, atmosphere)
- views
- menu
- input (pause game, return to state when die)
- enemies
- sound (already set up -> needs to not interfere with functionality/optimization of game)
