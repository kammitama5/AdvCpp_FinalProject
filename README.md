# AdvCpp_FinalProject
Hopefully a simple game

## Specifications

- Must use polymorphism
- Must use Inheritance
- Must use File I/O

## Ideas
- a Platformer game where I can add some basic tiles
- One level (use Paint or GIMP for tile sheet)
- Use OpenGL and glew, etc
- Learning experience for me

## Keep a log of progress to stay on track

- Week one:  10/30 to 11/4 - UML and basic plan done
- Week two:  11/6 to 11/11 (you are out of town on the 9th: Haskell!) - sprite sheet and bkground done
- Week three: 11/13 to 11/18 - working on player physics and everything loaded correctly
- Week four: 11/20 to 11/25 - working on physics
- Week five: 11/27 to 12/2 - menu and general debug
- three days 12/3 to 12/6 (final exam on 12/6) - general debug (you'll actually not be in town
- (extra time: hand in date is actually 12/12, but 12/6 is preferable if you'd like to do it in-person)
- I may prefer 12/12 to get it as polished as possible
